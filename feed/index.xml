										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live from the Sydney Fringe Festival host Mark Williamson and co-host Peter Green bring to you the quiz show Annus Horribilius.</p>
<p>Where two comedians, Carlo Sands and Peter Meisel battle it out with the audience over who knows the most about the year 1984.</p>
<p>*This show was recorded live on the night so there are some flaws in the process. We did not use microphones and just relied on the zoom.</p>
<p>If high quality state of the art recorded podcasts are your thing then maybe give this one a miss. </p>
<p>Follow everyone on twitter @MWChatShow, @greeny_eter, @PeterMeisel2, @CarloGrubSands and @TheUnOz. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s road trip time! That&#8217;s right host Mark Williamson headed down to Wollongong for a gig and took his recording gear with him. Joining him on the road in the driver&#8217;s seat Michael &#8216;Fluffy&#8217; French and in the back seat Seizure Kaiser.</p>
<p>The conversation was pre-gig and we were driving into a thunder storm. Enjoy!</p>
<p>*This week&#8217;s podcast has a bit of a language warning as the conversation got pretty deep (in a funny way). So if you are easily offended maybe skip this one. </p>
